    <h1>Bitcoin for Businesses</h1>
<p class="summary">Bitcoin is a very secure and inexpensive way to handle payments.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_lowfee.svg" alt="Low Fee" />The lowest fees out there</h2>
<p>Bitcoin's high cryptographic security allows it to process transactions in a very efficient and inexpensive way. You can make and receive payments using the Bitcoin network with zero fees in most cases. You can pay a very small voluntary fee if you want to increase a transaction's priority.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_shield.svg" alt="Protection" />Protection against payment and chargeback fraud</h2>
<p>Any business that accepts credit card or PayPal payments knows the problem of payments that are later reversed because the sender's account was hacked or they fraudulently claim non-delivery. The only way businesses can defend themselves against this kind of fraud is with complex risk analysis and increased prices to cover the losses. Bitcoin payments are irreversible and wallets can be kept highly secure, meaning that the cost of theft is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of merchants.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_international.svg" alt="International" />Fast international payments</h2>
<p>Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. In fact, bitcoins never have any real physical location. So it is possible to transfer as many of them anywhere with no limits, delays or excessive fees. There are no intermediate banks to make you wait three business days.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_pci.svg" alt="PCI" />No PCI compliance required</h2>
<p>Accepting credit cards online typically requires extensive security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. While it is a good thing to protect credit cards, Bitcoin security is built in such a way that makes this approach obsolete. Your payments are secured by the network, not at your expense.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_fast.svg" alt="Instant" />Instant transactions for points-of-sale</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin transaction is usually deployed within a few seconds and confirmed within 10 minutes. Before that, the transaction can be considered authentic but reversible. If you really require instant transactions, it is recommended to ask for a small transaction fee and use a double-spend detection system.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_visib.svg" alt="Visibility" />Get some free visibility</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching ways to spend their coins. Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has always shown to be a clever practice for online businesses.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_multi.svg" alt="Multi-signature" />Multi-signature</h2>
<p>Bitcoin also includes a feature that is not yet well known, allowing coins to be spent only if a subset of a group of people sign the transaction (so-called "n of m" transactions). This is the equivalent of the good old multi-signature cheque system that you might still use with banks today.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/ico_transparency.svg" alt="Transparency" />Accounting transparency</h2>
<p>Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity and to adopt good transparency practices. Using Bitcoin offers the highest level of transparency since your balance and your transactions are public for your members if you keep them aware of your Bitcoin addresses.</p>
