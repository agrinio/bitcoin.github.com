        <h1>Bitcoin Client Software</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a system of merchants, individuals, a network of participants and software. Together they maintain a mutually co-operating infrastructure without the need for authorities - a decentralised peer-to-peer system. A core layer of the Bitcoin system is the Bitcoin network through which people interact with it using Bitcoin client software. Below we list such software.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin clients are the base level of technology for conducting Bitcoin transactions. Clients usually store a collection of keys on that computer (often termed a wallet). These keys allow you to send and receive payments through the Bitcoin network. Nobody has access to these keys except yourself, and they must be kept secure. This is where clients differ, with ingenious strategies and ongoing research into making a user-friendly and secure client - not an easy task when both goals often conflict!</p>

              <h2><a href="http://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin-Qt</a></h2>
              <img src="img/clients/bitcoin-qt.png" />
              <p>The original software written by Satoshi Nakamoto, the
project's founder. If you aren't sure which program to
pick, this is a good bet. This application is a
peer-to-peer client that builds the backbone of the Bitcoin
network. It is suited for enthusiasts, merchants, miners,
developers and people who want to help support the project.
People who run Bitcoin-Qt are first class network citizens
and have the highest levels of security, privacy and
stability. However, it can be very resource intensive and
you should be willing to leave it running in the background
so other computers can connect to yours. If your computer
is low powered or you aren't willing to tolerate a 8-hour+
initial start time, you should consider other clients.
Cutting edge features tend to be implemented in other
clients first.

              <p>MultiBit's primary focus is being fast and easy to use,
even for people with no technical knowledge. It has a
YouTube channel to help you learn the software, and
includes helpful features such as an exchange rate ticker.
MultiBit supports many languages such as German, Spanish
and Greek. MultiBit synchronizes with the network much
faster than Bitcoin-Qt and should be ready for you to use
within a few minutes. This is a good choice for non
technical users who want an easy to use experience,
especially if you use a Mac.

              <p>Armory is a Bitcoin client that works on top of
Bitcoin-Qt, expanding it with functionality for Bitcoin
power users. It focuses on advanced features and security
options, including "cold-storage" for maintaining Bitcoins
on an offline computer to protect your funds from online
threats. Armory supports multiple encrypted wallets, each
of which only needs to be backed up once using a printer or
removable media. Armory is a good choice for experienced
Bitcoin users, seeking additional flexibility and security
for managing their funds.

times are instant because it operates in conjuction with
high-performance servers that handle the most complicated
parts of the Bitcoin system.

              <p>Bitcoin Wallet is a standalone wallet for Android devices.
Its primary focus is security, ease of use and being independant
of centralized network components (servers). Thus, it uses the
SPV (simple payment verification) model. It supports
initiating transactions via QR code,  Bitcoin URIs or near-field
communication (NFC). It has a useful currency conversion
calculator and is localized to a dozen languages.

            <p>Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.</p>
